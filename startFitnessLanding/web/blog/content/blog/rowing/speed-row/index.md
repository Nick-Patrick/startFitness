Keep your split times low. Focus on keeping stroke rate between 28 and 32. Pure rowing, all about the speed. 

Looking to increase your 500 meter split? This is the challenge for you. This is very much an interval challenge albeit over a longer duration, incorporating very hard rowing with short rest periods. It should take you around 45 minutes, though you can trim some sections off if you want a quicker workout.

This is a pretty simple workout, but it's a hard one. Once you've warmed up, you've got 6 seperate intervals. Each one consists of 5 sets of heavy rowing and short rest periods.
