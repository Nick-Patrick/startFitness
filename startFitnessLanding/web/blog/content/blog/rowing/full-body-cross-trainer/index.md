### Full-Body Cross Trainer Challenge

The total package to train your whole body. Work your core, legs, and arms, then some metabolic conditioning with burpees.

#### Warm Up

Get set up on the rowing machine and gradually increase the intensity of your rowing to get your body warmed up. Practice your technique and get ready for a tough workout.

> Light row for 60 seconds.

> Medium row at 22 SPM (Strokes Per Minute) for 60 seconds.

> Hard row at 26 SPM for 60 seconds.

> Light row at 18 SPM for 60 seconds.

#### Interval 1

For the first interval you're going to do 3 sets of hard rowing, 5 press ups and 5 v-ups. Try to move into each next exercise without any rest period. At the end of each set you can get a breather when setting yourself back into the rowing machine.

> Hard row at 26 SPM for 60 seconds.

> 5 Press Ups.

> 5 [V Ups](https://www.womenshealthmag.com/fitness/a20698650/v-ups/).

> 10 Burpees.

> Repeat 3 more times.

#### Interval 4

For this fourth and final interval you'll be alternating medium intensity rowing with 30 seconds of planking. If you find 30 seconds too easy, feel free to plank for longer, or even plank for as long as you can.

> Repeat 4 more times.

#### Cool Down
