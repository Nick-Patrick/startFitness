                  I collect data and information (through third party

                </p> <p><strong>Cookies</strong></p> <p>
                  Cookies are files with a small amount of data that are

                  to your browser from the websites that you visit and are

                  This Service does not use these “cookies” explicitly. However,
                  the app may use third party code and libraries that use
                  “cookies” to collect information and improve their services.

                </p> <p><strong>Service Providers</strong></p> <p>
                  I may employ third-party companies and
                  individuals due to the following reasons:
                </p> <ul><li>To facilitate our Service;</li> <li>To provide the Service on our behalf;</li> <li>To perform Service-related services; or</li> <li>To assist us in analyzing how our Service is used.</li></ul> <p>
                  I want to inform users of this Service
                  that these third parties have access to your Personal
                  Information. The reason is to perform the tasks assigned to
                  them on our behalf. However, they are obligated not to
                  disclose or use the information for any other purpose.
                </p> <p><strong>Security</strong></p> <p>
                  I value your trust in providing us your
                  Personal Information, thus we are striving to use commercially
                  acceptable means of protecting it. But remember that no method
                  of transmission over the internet, or method of electronic
                  storage is 100% secure and reliable, and I cannot
                  guarantee its absolute security.
                </p> <p><strong>Links to Other Sites</strong></p> <p>
                  This Service may contain links to other sites. If you click on
                  a third-party link, you will be directed to that site. Note
                  that these external sites are not operated by me.
                  Therefore, I strongly advise you to review the

                  identifiable information from children under 13. In the case
                  I discover that a child under 13 has provided
                  me with personal information, I immediately
                  delete this from our servers. If you are a parent or guardian
                  and you are aware that your child has provided us with
                  personal information, please contact me so that
                  I will be able to do necessary actions.
