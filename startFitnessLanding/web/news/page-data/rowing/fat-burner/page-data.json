Try this Tabata based workout for maximum fat burning in minimum time. A mix of rowing sprints with full-body exercises.</p>\n<p>One of the most versatile cardiovascular options available to you, the rowing machine will effectively punish your body into submission. According to <a href=\"https://www.britishrowing.org/\">British Rowing</a>, the exercise uses 85 percent of your muscles across nine different major muscle groups. What better way to get your heart and metabolic rate up, than mixing rowing with some full-body exercises!</p>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 590px; \"\n    >\n      <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/news/static/582d627979e9dfe6b23b430a1689b95d/bd53b/sea-2.jpg\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n    <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 66.89189189189189%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,/9j/2wBDABALDA4MChAODQ4SERATGCgaGBYWGDEjJR0oOjM9PDkzODdASFxOQERXRTc4UG1RV19iZ2hnPk1xeXBkeFxlZ2P/2wBDARESEhgVGC8aGi9jQjhCY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2P/wgARCAANABQDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAGAAAAwEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQFAQL/xAAVAQEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAv/aAAwDAQACEAMQAAAB5ZjbcOkoP//EABkQAAMBAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABAgMRBP/aAAgBAQABBQKMej87U8lE62h6U0f/xAAVEQEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQIf/aAAgBAwEBPwGH/8QAFREBAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABH/2gAIAQIBAT8Bqv/EABoQAAICAwAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAhAQIDEBH/2gAIAQEABj8CEPLUUnNf/8QAGhAAAwADAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAERIUFhUf/aAAgBAQABPyGgsEV6xuSjhpQqTxaY8R//2gAMAwEAAgADAAAAENwP/8QAFhEBAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAER/9oACAEDAQE/EIbH/8QAFREBAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABH/2gAIAQIBAT8QtT//xAAcEAEAAwACAwAAAAAAAAAAAAABABEhMUFRccH/2gAIAQEAAT8QUrNeoxV9YIoCHIiiIFlPERg0oZrHXyn/2Q=='); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"Burn Fat with Rowing\"\n        title=\"Burn Fat with Rowing\"\n        src=\"/news/static/582d627979e9dfe6b23b430a1689b95d/1c72d/sea-2.jpg\"\n        srcset=\"/news/static/582d627979e9dfe6b23b430a1689b95d/a80bd/sea-2.jpg 148w,\n/news/static/582d627979e9dfe6b23b430a1689b95d/1c91a/sea-2.jpg 295w,\n/news/static/582d627979e9dfe6b23b430a1689b95d/1c72d/sea-2.jpg 590w,\n/news/static/582d627979e9dfe6b23b430a1689b95d/a8a14/sea-2.jpg 885w,\n/news/static/582d627979e9dfe6b23b430a1689b95d/fbd2c/sea-2.jpg 1180w,\n/news/static/582d627979e9dfe6b23b430a1689b95d/bd53b/sea-2.jpg 2250w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 590px) 100vw, 590px\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n      />\n  </a>\n    </span></p>\n<h3>Fat Burner Rowing Workout</h3>\n<p>This is a Tabata based workout, in other words, high-intensity interval training that’ll incorporate 20 seconds hard rowing with 10 seconds of light working out. After we’ve completed those we’ll move into very high intensity rowing mixed with some body weight exercises.</p>\n<h4>Warm Up</h4>\n<p>Focus on getting those muscles warmed up. Keep your body loose and flexible while practicing your rowing technique.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>1 minute light rowing at 18 SPM.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>1 minute medium rowing at 22 SPM.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>1 minute hard rowing at 26 SPM.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>1 minute light rowing at 18 SPM.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h4>Interval 1</h4>\n<p>Pretty simple. Light row for 10 seconds, then row hard for 20 seconds. Repeat for a total of 8 sets.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>10 seconds light rowing at 18 SPM.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>20 seconds hard rowing at 26 SPM.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Repeat 7 more times.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h4>Interval 2</h4>\n<p>After completing each set of rowing, use your transition on and off the rowing machine as your rest period.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Row 250 meters as fast as possible.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>25 Squat jumps.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Row 200 meters as fast as possible.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>20 <a href=\"https://i.makeagif.com/media/12-19-2016/HGcceH.gif\">Lunge jumps</a>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Row 150 meters as fast as possible.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>15 Press ups.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Row 100 meters as fast as possible.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>10 <a href=\"https://i.makeagif.com/media/9-02-2015/FTOfKr.gif\">Squat thrusts</a>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Row 50 meters as fast as possible.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>5 Burpees.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h4>Interval 3</h4>\n<p>You’ll be rowing as hard as you can here. Make sure not to sacrifice form, keep your body strong. Drive through the legs, while taking big deep breaths. If you’re going to repeat this workout, note down your distances so you can track your improvement.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>60 seconds row as fast as possible.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>30 Seconds rest.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>60 seconds row as fast as possible.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h4>Cool Down</h4>\n<p>Row lightly for 2 minutes, and follow up with a few stretches wherever you’re feeling tight. I always make sure to at least stretch my <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gE6mJ0VjK7Y\">glutes</a> and <a href=\"https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/323703\">hamstrings</a>.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>2 minutes light rowing at 18 SPM.</p>\n</blockquote>","frontmatter":{"title":"Burn Fat with this Tabata-Based Rowing Challenge","date":"May 20, 2020","description":"In a rush?
